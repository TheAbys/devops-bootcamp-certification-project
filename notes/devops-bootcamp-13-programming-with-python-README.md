# 13 - Programming Basics with Python

Nothing new for me besides syntactic differences to other programming languages.

## 1 - 15 Conlusion

Learning all the syntactic basics for writing python code.

- Data Types (String, Number)
- Variables
- Functions / Built-In functions
- User input (terminal input)
- Conditionals (if/else and Boolean)
- Error handling (try-except)
- Loops (For/While)
- Comments (inline, block)
- Sets

## 16 - Dictonary Data Type

Learn about the dictonary data type and how to use it.

Folder **days-to-units** contains a simple example for this.

## 17 - Modules

Learn to structure code in modules/packages to keep everything well structured and well read.

Folder **modules** contains a simple example for this.

## 18 - Project: Countdown App

Example project to handle dates, inputs, outputs, conditions, loops, error-handling, ...

Folder **countdown-project** contains a simple example for this.

## 19 - Packages, PyPi and pip

Packages are found on [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/)

Pip is the package manger for python. Installing packages is done using pip.

    pip install djanog

Using the package in the python code without installing it first gives a warning and the package can obviously not be used.

    import django

Uninstall a package

    pip uninstall djanog

In our own project we use a **requirements.txt** file for installing required packages

    pip install -r requirements.txt

In more complexe cases it could also be practical to use **pipenv** for handling the packages and installing them in virtual environments.

## 20 - Project: Automation with Python (Spreadsheet)

Handle spreadsheets with Python. Loading data from it, looping over it, outputting some data to the terminal.

Folder **automation-inventory-project** contains a simple example for this.

## 21 - OOP: Classes and Objects

Working with classes and objects. Defining what a specific properties and methods a class has and initializing objects of them.

Folder **classes-and-objects** contains a simple example for this.

## 22 - Project: API Request to GitLab

Learning how to make requests to other websites/apis and retrieving data from them.

Folder **gitlab-api-request** contains a simple example for this.
